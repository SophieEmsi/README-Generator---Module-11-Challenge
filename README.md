# README-Generator---Module-11-Challenge

## Description

This is a project that involves creating a README file generator using Node.js. The generator prompts the user with a series of questions, such as project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, license, how to contribute, and test instructions. The user's answers are then used to generate a high-quality README file. The goal of this project is to automate the process of creating README files, which are an important part of any software project as they provide information about the project, how to install and use it, and other relevant details. This project saves developers time and effort by generating a professional-looking README file quickly and easily.
